# Image-Caption-Generator

A Deep learning project that automatically generates captions for images using Flickr8k dataset, Xception model for extracting features from images, RNN model (LSTM) for predicting sequence data, and several NLP toolkits.

## About Dataset

This dataset consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events.  Download the dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k and paste into this folder.

## To run this project please follow this steps:

* Download and extract this whole project
* Create a folder named 'ColabNotebooks' in root directory of your Google Drive.
* Then upload extracted version of project into the 'ColabNotebooks' folder
* Now create a notebook in  Google Colab by your preferred name, and paste all shells from Caption.ipynb
